# Development Priorities for MFC Biofilm Control System

## Priority Rankings

### Most Critical (Implement First)
1. **Real-time monitoring dashboard** - Essential for system operation, debugging, and safety monitoring
2. **Long-term stability studies** - Critical for understanding system reliability and preventing failures in production
3. **Multi-stack coordination** - If you're scaling beyond single units, this becomes foundational

### High Priority (Next Phase)
4. **Adaptive biofilm control** - Core improvement to system effectiveness
5. **Cloud deployment support** - Enables remote monitoring and scalability

### Medium Priority (Future Development)
6. **Economic optimization** - Important for adoption but requires stable base system
7. **Multi-species optimization** - Advanced research with high potential impact
8. **Advanced ML algorithms** - Enhancement once core functionality is solid

## Reasoning

- **Monitoring and stability** are prerequisites for any production system
- **Multi-stack coordination** is architectural - harder to retrofit later
- **Research directions** should build on stable operational foundation
- **Economic and advanced ML optimizations** provide the most value when the system is already reliable

The real-time dashboard and stability studies address the highest risks while providing immediate operational value.
