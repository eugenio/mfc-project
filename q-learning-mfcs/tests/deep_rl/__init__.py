"""
Deep Reinforcement Learning Tests

Comprehensive test suite for deep RL controller components including:
- Neural network architectures (DuelingDQN, RainbowDQN, NoisyLinear)
- Experience replay buffers (PriorityReplayBuffer)
- Deep RL controller functionality
- Algorithm configurations and enums

Tests use mocking for PyTorch operations and environment interactions
to ensure reproducible and fast test execution.
