# Audio Notifier Sound Files

Place your custom sound files in this directory:

## File Names (case-sensitive):
- `success.wav` - Played when tests pass (TDD green light)
- `failure.wav` - Played when tests fail (TDD red light) 
- `completion.wav` - Played when feature/sprint is complete

## Supported Formats:
- WAV (recommended)
- MP3
- AIFF (macOS)

## Recommended Sources:
- **Pixabay** - Free, no attribution required
- **Mixkit** - 36+ free notification sounds
- **FreeSoundSite** - Task completion sounds

## Volume Guidelines:
- Keep files under 2 seconds duration
- Test volume levels to avoid startling during coding
- Use consistent volume levels across all three files

If custom files are missing, the system will fall back to default OS sounds.
